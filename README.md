# 🐤 Flappy Bird Clone - React Native Game

A fun and challenging **Flappy Bird clone** built using **React Native**, **React Native Skia**, and **Reanimated**. This mobile game replicates the core gameplay mechanics of the original Flappy Bird with custom graphics, smooth animations, and basic physics logic — all without using a game engine.

## 🚀 Features

- 🕹️ Custom 2D game loop using Reanimated
- 🐤 Bird movement with gesture-based controls
- 🎨 Graphics rendered using **React Native Skia**
- 💥 Collision detection between bird & pipes
- 🧠 Scoring system and game over state
- 🎯 Lightweight and responsive on both iOS and Android
- 📲 Built with **Expo** for fast development and testing
